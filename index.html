<p>In 1937, the animated classic, <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i>, the first feature-length animation to be produced in the United States, is important in the history of animation.  Even though this movie is considered to be the first feature-length animated feature, they would be wrong with stating this because there have been other animators such as Lotte Reiniger, with the movie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25SP4ftxklg"><i>The Adventures of Prince Achmed</i></a> (1926), and Quirino Cristiani, with the movie, <i>The Apostle</i> (1917). Both of these movies ran the feature film length time and were primarily animated and produced in other countries. With <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i>, the amount of pressure from the general audience and from himself caused him to show off what he has been working for in the past few years by working on short animated cartoons. (Cavalier)</p>

<p>Walt Disney was able to test out all of the techniques that would be later used in <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i>, including the use of color,  more dynamic character animation, and the multiplane camera. In 1932, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jkh5ojRXKYM"><i>Flowers and Trees</i></a> was released and it showcased a new form that would later become essential all animation, color. Walt Disney saw and knew that  Technicolor was going to be released and Disney was able to mark up a deal with Technicolor so that only Disney Studios would have exclusive rights to this technology. It was way to make sure that when the audience saw his shorts and future feature films, that they would have the knowledge that they were seeing the most advanced animated short being produced. Disney kept advancing his character animation. In 1933, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM47onzkGek"><i>Three Little Pigs</i></a>, the main characters, the pigs “sharing almost identical character design, have very distinct personalities” (Cavalier 105). This kept Disney’s animation department, ahead of the other studios. In 1936, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYEmL0d0lZE"><i>The Old Mill</i></a>, it demonstrated his idea of making the world that his team created to have a more realistic feel. Even though the multiplane camera was first introduced in Lotte Reiniger in her movie, <i>The Adventures of Prince Achmed</i>. It gave more depth to the scene. Disney produced the most advanced multiplane camera. By having each of the areas of a scene to be separated out and also lit individually as well.</p>

<p>These all came into play during the production of this movie. With the exclusive deal with Technicolor gave the audience that they were watching the movie as if pages from the fairytale stories illustrations were being reproduced. The character animation was able to mix the hand drawn character animation and the rotoscoping technique. No other studios were able to create a realistic human character. The human characters “were never intended to be strictly realistic characters, but they did have to represent a fantasy element that was recognizably grounded in reality” (Kaufman 40). Instead of the traditional rotoscoping technique by having the outlines noticeable, they used the film stills to give the animator guidance to how to construct the human characters. It helped the audience to appreciate the amount of time, used animating Snow White, and they did not have to encounter the outlines of a traditional rotoscoping technique. The multi-plane camera usage allowed for dynamic scenes. It was used so that “the audience was not looking at a flat painting but rather was drawn into a convincing animated world” (Kaufman 33). It was able to give the sense of depth and did not play with unnatural proportion that would often occur when filming at painted background.</p>

<p>With these advancement, Walt Disney was able to produce a feature film that was able to show off what they have been working on for the past few years. After trial and error, from working on their short films and also the partnerships and creation of certain aspect of the animation business. Causing the Walt Disney Studios to be ahead of its time and also beating out their competition. This is important in animation history because it was the first time a United States studio produced an animated feature film. While using some of the most polished and advance techniques, that not a lot of other studios at the time was able to have access to.</p>
